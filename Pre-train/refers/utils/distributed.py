raise exceptions in absence of distributed training / CPU-only training, and

    r"""
    Launch a job in a distributed fashion: given ``num_machines`` machines,
    each with ``num_gpus_per_machine`` GPUs, this utility will launch one
    process per GPU. This wrapper uses :func:`torch.multiprocessing.spawn`.

    The user has to launch one job on each machine, manually specifying a
    machine rank (incrementing integers from 0), this utility will adjust
    process ranks per machine. One process on ``machine_rank = 0`` will be
    refered as the *master process*, and the IP + a free port on this machine
    will serve as the distributed process communication URL.

    Default arguments imply one machine with one GPU, and communication URL
    as ``localhost``.

    .. note::

        This utility assumes same number of GPUs per machine with IDs as
        ``(0, 1, 2 ...)``. If you do not wish to use all GPUs on a machine,
        set ``CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`` environment variable (for example,
        ``CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=5,6``, which restricts to GPU 5 and 6 and
        re-assigns their IDs to 0 and 1 in this job scope).

    Parameters
    ----------
    job_fn: Callable
        A callable object to launch. Pass your main function doing training,
        validation etc. here.
    num_machines: int, optional (default = 1)
        Number of machines used, each with ``num_gpus_per_machine`` GPUs.
    num_gpus_per_machine: int, optional (default = 1)
        Number of GPUs per machine, with IDs as ``(0, 1, 2 ...)``.
    machine_rank: int, optional (default = 0)
        A manually specified rank of the machine, serves as a unique identifier
        and useful for assigning global ranks to processes.
    dist_url: str, optional (default = "tcp://127.0.0.1:23456")
        Disributed process communication URL as ``tcp://x.x.x.x:port``. Set
        this as the IP (and a free port) of machine with rank 0.
    args: Tuple
        Arguments to be passed to ``job_fn``.
