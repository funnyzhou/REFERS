/data1/zyh/zyh_data/files/p19/p19950864/s52815959/	there is mild interstitial edema , and the heart is normal in size . a left basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis versus pneumonia . there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax . mild interstitial edema . left basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis though infection can be considered in the appropriate clinical setting .
/data1/zyh/zyh_data/files/p19/p19950864/s50986956/	the cardiac , mediastinal and hilar contours appears unchanged . there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax . parenchymal abnormalities appear unchanged and reflect emphysema with mild accompanying interstitial disease . subpleural scarring and a small hyperdense nodules at the right lung apex appear unchanged . scarring and bullous changes are also stable at the base of the left chest . the chest is hyperinflated . there has been no significant change . no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease .
/data1/zyh/zyh_data/files/p19/p19950864/s58368837/	frontal and lateral views of the chest show no acute intrathoracic process . flattened diaphragms and pulmonary blebs are consistent with obstructive lung disease . the mediastinum and pleural structures are unremarkable . calcifications are seen within the aortic arch . the shoulders are not fully evaluated , however , there are no suspicious osseous lesions . degenerative changes are seen within the thoracic spine . no acute intrathoracic process .
